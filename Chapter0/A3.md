## A Basic Memory Model

As you might already know, computers rememember stuff in RAM to calculate on. Ram exists as a giant
set of bits, each holding a 1 or 0. And bits are organized into bytes (8 bits, usually) which store everything.
As you might not already know, instruction sets operate on that memory, add a number from one place to another.
That memory has an address, which is where the first byte is.
