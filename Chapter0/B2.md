## Makefiles

Before we get to programming, let's cover makefiles first. A makefile is a set of targets
and commands to compile those targets. For example:
```Makefile
.PHONEY: clean, test

a.out: main.cpp
	clang++ main.cpp -g -Og -o a.out -std=c++17

clean:
	rm a.out

test: a.out
	./a.out

default: clean, a.out, test
```
The targets are a.out, clean, test, and default. The dependencies are listed after the colon,
and the commands are listed on the lines below. To compile the default target, run "make".
It'll remove the old a.out, then compile a.out again. This is mostly for conveience, so that
you won't have to type out all the commands repeatedly.
