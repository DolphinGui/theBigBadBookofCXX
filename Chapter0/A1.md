## What Code Even is

Computers do magic every day. Millions upon millions of lines of code run the world, most of which most people barely even know about.
What a programmer does is not worry about any of that. Programmers work with magic every day, not caring about how their code even works
because that's not relevent. And that's fine, unless the code doesn't work.

Of course, its sort of hard to program while completely in the dark about how anything works. That only leads to cargo cult programming:
replicating initial conditions in hopes of reproducing results. A programmer may not need to know how other's code work, but they are
expected to know how their own code works.

That leads me to the very basis of what code is: code is a set of instructions produced for a computer to follow.
