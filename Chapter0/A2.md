## Machines, Binaries, and Instructions

A computer is surprisingly simple when it comes down to it. At the end of the day, all it really does
is crunch numbers and make decisions. What it can do is specified by it's ISA (Instruction Set Architecture).
From there, it communicates to other things that are connected to it.

When a programmer writes code, what they really do is write a bunch of text that a compiler figures out. It
turns text to instructions that a cpu can understand, then packages it in a way the operating system can load.
