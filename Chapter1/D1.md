## Templates

```c++
struct coord_uint32_t{
  uint32_t x, y;
}
struct coord_uint16_t{
  uint16_t x, y;
}
// and so on and so on
```

In coding there's a principle called DRY, which stands for don't repeat
yourself. Coding is literally meant to automate menial tasks, so doing
something menial is wasting time as you could write code to do it for you.
In this case, c++ gives programmers templates to avoid duplicating code for types.

```c++
template<typename value>
struct coord{
  value x, y;
}
template<typename type>
type functionalStyle(type a, type b){
  return a-b; //pretend this does something more complex
}
```

Here a template replaces the type, avoiding the need for duplication.
This allows for generic containers and algorithims, which work regardless
of what the underlying type is. Mind that each template is it's own type,
and generates its own code. Having too many template types means that a lot
of code may be generated, which can slow performance and bloat executable
sizes.
