## Control Structures
### if

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
  bool a = true;
  if(a){
    cout << "a is true";
  } else {
    cout << "a is false";
  }
}
```

This is about conditionals and loops, which are probably the second
most important part of programming. An if statement only executes
the stuff in the brackets **if** the statement in the paranthesis
evaluates to true. Notably integers can be evaluated as booleans,
where 0 is false and anything else is true.

### while and do-while
```c++
void repeat4(char* string){
  int a = 4;
  while(a){
    cout << string;
  }
  int b = string;
  do{
    cout << b;
  }while(b);
}
```

While and do while-loops repeat themselves while the condition is true.
While loops test if the condition is true at the beginning, while the
do-while loops test it at the end. This means that do loops always
execute at least once, while while loops are effectively also if statements.

### for loops
```c++
void printSeries(){
  for(int a = 0; a < 4; a++){
    cout << a;
  }
}
void printArray(){
  int[] array = {2,1,5,124};
  for(int a : array){
    cout << a;
  }
}
```
For loops are used to repeat things a set number of times, or to iterate
through an array. It's similar to a while loop, except a variable can
be set at the beginning, and a line will be applied at the end.

The other for loop is called a range for loop. It was introduced in c++11,
which should work on most modern compilers. It iterates through an array,
executing code in the brackets with all of the values in the array. How
it exactly works is will be discussed along with the STL.
