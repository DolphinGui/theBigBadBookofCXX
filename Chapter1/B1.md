## Classes and Structs, and Methods

### Structs

```c++
struct Coordinate{
  int x, y;
};
Coordinate a = {2,1};
int x = a.x; // x = 2
int y = a.y; // y = 1
```

Structs are a bundle of variables put together. Any of the variables in the struct, called members, can
be accessed as shown above. Structs can be used as function parameters, and referred to by references
and pointers just as builtin types are.

The values of a struct can be initialized like an array, unless it has private members. If it does,
it must be constructed via array. Constructors and visibility are covered in the next few sections.
```c++
class fruit{
  int a;
public:
  int b;
  int addA(int x){ return a + x; }
  banana(int a, b): a(a), b(b){
    cout << "banana constructed";
  }
  ~banana(){
    cout << "banana destroyed";
  }
};
int main(){
  fruit banana(1,2); // banana constructed
  int x = banana.a; // Error: a is not a public member
  int y = banana.b; // y = 2
  banana.addA(4); //returns 5
} // banana destroyed
```
As you can see, classes are similar to structs. By default, members in classes
are private (technically not, but I'll cover that later) by default. Member
functions are also called methods, and are equivalent to passing a reference
of the object being called to the function.

Functions with no return value and the same name as the class are constructors.
They accept parameters, then intialize members listed after the colon as if
they were written in the brackets. Then the code in the brackets are run.

Functions with no return value and the class name starting with a tilde are
called destructors. They run when the object goes out of scope.
```c++
class inner{
  ~inner(){
    cout << "inner destroyed ";
  }
};
class outer{
  ~outer(){
    cout << "outer destroyed ";
  }
};

int main(){
  outer a;
} // outer destroyed, inner destroyed

```
Objects, as you can see, are destroyed from the outside in.

### Methods

```c++
class hidden{
  int a = 2;
  int doSomething(){}
public:
  int readA(){ return a; }
};
int main(){
  hidden object;
  object.readA(); // returns 2
  object.doSomething(); //error, method is not visible
}
```

The difference between just Plain Old Data (POD) and objects is that objects have 
functions associated with them. They can access even hidden members, and are 
often used to regulate how data is changed or to simplify syntax. 

### Operator Overloading

```c++
struct coordinate{
  int x, y;
  coordinate& operator+=(const coordinate& rhs) {
    x += rhs.x;
    y += rhs.y;
    return *this;
  }
  coordinate& operator-=(const coordinate& rhs) {
    x -= rhs.x;
    y -= rhs.y;
    return *this;
  }
  friend coordinate operator+(coordinate, coordinate);
  friend coordinate operator-(coordinate lhs, const coordinate& rhs)
{
    lhs -= rhs;
    return lhs;
}
}
coordinate operator+(coordinate lhs, const coordinate& rhs)
{
    lhs += rhs;
    return lhs;
}
coordinate a{2,5};
coordinate b{5,1};
coordinate c = a + b; // {7,6}

```

As you can see, the addition and addition assignment operators can be overloaded. Most
of the operators in c++ can be overloaded to simplify syntax. Friend functions are functions
not neccessarily inside the class, but still able to access it's private members. They can
be forward declared, or defined inline. Classes can also be friends, allowing one class's
methods to access another's hidden methods and variables.
