## Classes and Structs

```c++
struct Coordinate{
  int x, y;
};
Coordinate a = {2,1};
int x = a.x; // x = 2
int y = a.y; // y = 1
```

Structs are a bundle of variables put together. Any of the variables in the struct, called members, can
be accessed as shown above. Structs can be used as function parameters, and referred to by references
and pointers just as builtin types are.

The values of a struct can be initialized like an array, unless it has private members. If it does,
it must be constructed via array. Constructors and visibility are covered in the next few sections.
```c++
class fruit{
  int a;
public:
  int b;
  int addA(int x){ return a + x; }
  banana(int a, b): a(a), b(b){
    cout << "banana constructed";
  }
};

fruit banana(1,2);
int x = banana.a; // Error: a is not a public member
int y = banana.b; // y = 2
banana.addA(4); //returns 5
```
As you can see, classes are similar to structs. By default, members in classes
are private (technically not, but I'll cover that later) by default. Member
functions are also called methods, and are equivalent to passing a reference
of the object being called to the function.
