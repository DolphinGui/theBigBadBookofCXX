# A Complete Guide to C++

This is a a text on c++ intended towards both people completely
new to programming, as well as people with mild experience in other
languages wanting to learn c++.

## Why write one?

There weren't many comprehensive guides out there on c++, so I mostly
had to self-learn. This is both an attempt to rectify that and also to
solidify my own knowledge.

## What will this cover?

Check the [index](index.md). It'll probably cover just about everthing, ranging
from build systems, memory models, idioms, programming paradigms in
c++, templates, the standard library, and probably a lot more.
